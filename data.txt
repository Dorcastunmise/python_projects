Assumptions

- The /data directory contains a large number of files and subdirectories.
- Only the game-related directories are of interest.
- Each game is stored inside a directory whose name contains the word "game".
- Inside every game directory, there is exactly one .go source file which must be compiled before running.

 Project Steps / Requirements

- Locate Game Directories
- Search through the /data directory and identify all subdirectories whose names include "game".
- Prepare Target Directory
- Create a new /games directory that will hold all the processed games.
- Organize Games
- Copy each identified game into the /games directory.
- While copying, remove the "game" suffix from the directory name to keep things clean and consistent.
- Generate Metadata
- Create a .json file that stores structured information about all the discovered games (e.g., original path, new path, game name, and source file).
- Compile Game Code
- For each game, compile its .go source file to produce an executable.
- Execute Games
- Run the compiled executables to verify that they work as expected.
